# @deepseek-ai/dsh-platform-user-api

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

`dsh-platform-user-api` exposes the employee-side authentication touchpoints over the local webserver: `GET /api/enterprise/auth/me` verifies a Supabase JWT and announces `platform-user/verified`, `POST /signout` announces `platform-user/signout`, `GET /config` hands the browser the Supabase URL and anon key, and `POST /connectivity-check` probes server URLs from Node where browsers cannot. The plugin holds no state; identity-cache consumers subscribe to the events.

## Use this package

Use this package on the enterprise profile as the login integration point: the browser login flow verifies itself against `/me`, the settings panel reads `/config` and probes targets via `/connectivity-check`, and the signout touchpoint tells the local cache to drop the identity. Governance writes (register, approve, disable, lock, restore, roles, audit) live in the web-console backend, not here.

### Minimal configuration

Both fields are required with no default: a composition that omits either fails at load. They are exactly the Supabase project coordinates the browser needs to talk to Supabase Auth directly.

```yaml
- name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-platform-user-api'
  config:
    supabaseUrl: 'https://your-project.supabase.co'
    supabaseAnonKey: 'your-anon-key'
```

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `supabaseUrl` | required | Supabase project URL; volatile — the settings panel can change it without a reload |
| `supabaseAnonKey` | required | Supabase anon key for browser-side Supabase Auth; volatile |

### What each endpoint does

| Method | Path | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/enterprise/auth/me` | Verifies the `Authorization: Bearer` JWT, returns the user record, emits `platform-user/verified` with the raw token |
| POST | `/api/enterprise/auth/signout` | Emits `platform-user/signout`, answers 204 |
| GET | `/api/enterprise/auth/config` | Returns `{ url, anonKey }` read fresh per request |
| POST | `/api/enterprise/auth/connectivity-check` | Probes a URL from Node (any HTTP status counts as reachable), 5s timeout |

## Understand the implementation

<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

This section explains the design decisions and points at the code; the observable behavior is covered in [Use this package](#use-this-package).

### Events, not state

The plugin keeps no identity state ([src/index.ts](src/index.ts)): a verified `/me` call emits `platform-user/verified` carrying the raw access token — consumers such as the identity cache and skill sync then act as the signed-in employee against server APIs — and the signout touchpoint emits `platform-user/signout`. Until a client calls `/me`, subscribers do not learn of a login.

### Why connectivity-check runs in Node

The engine, web-console, and SkillHub endpoints do not enable CORS, so a browser-side probe would misreport correctly configured servers as unreachable. The endpoint therefore fetches from Node, where any HTTP status means "the host answered"; only http/https URLs are accepted.

### Why the anon key is not marked secret

A secret-typed config field is permanently masked once read over the wire, so the settings panel could never display it again. The anon key is public by design; the panel masks it in its own UI, and the webserver binds to localhost only.

## Further Exploration

- [Enterprise group README](../README.md) — the sibling enterprise packages and how the two profiles compose them.
- [Internal SSO design](../../../docs/plans/2026-09-29-internal-pass-sso-design.md) — the Supabase-based identity model these endpoints serve.

<a id="model-experience"></a>
## Model Experience

None, as these are auth endpoints and configuration projection; they register nothing model-facing.

#### KV Cache effect

Sign-in and sign-out change which identity subsequent requests carry, not the model context; nothing here touches a cached conversation prefix.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

These limits define what the package does not attempt. They are current constraints, not a task backlog.

- **Events fire only on API calls** — `platform-user/verified` emits when a client fetches `/me`; there is no push channel from Supabase, and a component that never calls the endpoints never sees the login.
- **Read-only projection** — the endpoints expose no governance write path; register, approve, disable, lock, and roles stay in web-console.
- **Probe is a plain GET** — connectivity-check counts any HTTP status, including error pages, as reachable; it answers "is the host there", not "is the service healthy".
- **Unauthenticated config surface** — `/config` hands out the Supabase coordinates without authentication; safe because the webserver binds to localhost, and wrong if that ever changes.

### Dev Note

<details>
<summary>Working context for maintainers — click to expand</summary>

Identity verification itself (JWT validation, user lookup, status checks) is owned by dsh-platform-user; this package is route plumbing plus the two event touchpoints. No open work here.
