# Enterprise

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

The enterprise group hosts the employee-facing platform layer: auth endpoints verify the signed-in employee against governance records, `ctx.currentUser` and the per-turn identity block carry that identity into the session, and Flowable-facing packages connect DSH to the process engine — task forwarding, backend-task runners, and the process-start tool. Companion packages pre-install pending-task skills, inject knowledge-base blocks, route model calls through the enterprise quota proxy, and delete archived sessions. Each package README owns its per-package contract.
